"There are two types of models: push and pull. If you have a sequence, "
"then in the case of a *push* model the calculations are initiated by the "
"first member of the sequence, which pushes data further. In this case a "

" one sequence, but into two."

"In the case of a *pull* model the calculations are initiated by the last "
"member of the sequence. Consequently, if we want to branch the sequence, "
"we need to think what to do: to start only when all consumers asked, to "

"others conforming to the *push* model."
msgstr ""
"В случае pull модели вычисления инициирует последний член цепочки. "
"Соответственно, если мы хотим разветвить цепочку, то уже надо думать, что"
" делать: или запускать только когда запросили все потребители, или делать"
" буферизацию, или стартовать с одного потребителя, а в остальные "
"пропихивать данные по push модели."

"Functional programming suggests that larger functions should be "

"cohesion. The decisions above were made by choosing between these "

"function of that, like a mean or a mode (which again suggests a different"

"In part 1 of the tutorial there was introduced an element *End*, which "

"It depends on the student's priorities. If he wants to finish the diploma"
" never to return to programming, or if he has a lot of work to do apart "
"from writing code, the fastest option might be the best. General "
"algorithms have a more complicated interface. However, if one decides to "
"rely upon a \"friendly\" library, there is a risk that the programmer "
"will have to rewrite all code when more functionality becomes needed."

"Another distinction is that when using a library one learns how to use a "
"library. When using a good framework, one learns how to write good code. "
"Many algorithms in programming are simple, but to choose a good design "
"may be much more difficult, and to learn how to create good programs "
"yourself may take years of studying and experience. When you feel "
"difficulties with making programming decisions, it's time to invest into "
"design skills."
