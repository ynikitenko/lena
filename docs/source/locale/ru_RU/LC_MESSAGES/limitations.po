"Functional programming may seem weird without a filter, but in fact the "
"author didn't need to use that, and when he needed, a better solution was"
" found. Moreover, Lena's design suggests that one should expect any "
"unknown values from the flow (if that's not during histogram fill), and "
"pass that unchanged. One can very simply implement a filter using a "
":class:`Selector`."

"Zip may also not fit well with Lena's design, because it would impose "
"limitations on the order of flow elements (if that is important). It may "
"also be duplication of some :class:`Split`'s logic."
